# Getting started

When selecting a dataset, use it as an opportunity to research a problem that you might be interested in or want to learn more about. For instance, you might be curious about how the COVID-19 quarantine affected the global CO₂ emissions.
Perhaps you've read that [Coronavirus could cause fall in global CO2 emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-could-cause-fall-in-global-co2-emissions) or that [Coronavirus temporarily reduced China’s CO2 emissions by a quarter](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter). You can compare the current findings with the information that has been collected in [Beijing from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data) or look at the current trends using the data of [carbon dioxide measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/mlo.html).
One of the other sites that we mentioned above also has a dataset and an in-depth article on [CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions). This might prompt you to go to the US Environmental Protection Agency and read more about the [greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases). Cross-referencing it with [several other climate datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#climate-weather) could make for a really interesting and potentially informative report.
You can use all these links and resources as part of the narrative of your final report. 


# Example datasets

Below are a few datasets that tutors have found to be interesting and worth exploring:

* U.S. Educational Finances - https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-educational-finances#states.csv.
Revenues and expenditures for U.S. grade schools, by year and state.

* World University Rankings - https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings.
Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places.

* Placement data of students in our campus - https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement/data.
Includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students
Potential questions:
Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?
Does percentage matters for one to get placed?
Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?

* Student Alcohol Consumption - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption.
Social, gender and study data from secondary school students - math and portuguese majors.  Family size, parents' occupation, income, travel time from school to home, study time,  class failures, even alcohol consumption that this dataset is called after, we could analyze travel time, income, and travel time or class failures - there is so many potential relationships to analyze. 

* Grad school admission: https://debarghyadas.com/writes/the-grad-school-statistics-we-never-had/

* A list of colleges and universities offering degrees in data science. http://datascience.community/colleges

* An interesting article and a dataset on sexism in Hollywood - https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/.
The data includes a list of movies with data on how women are portrayed in cinema. Potential starting question: are movies with a higher budget less sexist?

* An interesting dataset on fatal collisions per state. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/ Grouped by state, it has statistics of how many fatal collisions there are per miles driven, and then out of fatal collisions, how many drivers were speeding, were distracted, how many were DUI's , and what car insurance premiums there are, per state. Also, what the costs are per state of insurance companies to cover damages per insured driver.

* Avocado Prices - https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices.
Historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets

* RFM (recency, frequency and monetary) analysis: https://rfm.rsquaredacademy.com/


* Firearm permits and background checks-  https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks. The data in this repository comes from the FBI's [National Instant Criminal Background Check System](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics). Buzzfeed's large dataset on firearm background checks by state, over time. One could analyze which states have the most guns or which states grant more permits, which states are growing the fastest, see which states are leaders for each kind of firearm permit issued, can use a lot of functions we talked about in this course.

* Baseball Data - http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ and https://www.baseball-reference.com/.
These datasets cover 1871-2019 batting/pitching stats for baseball (covers both players and teams) with plenty of metadata. Possible areas of exploration could include player performance comparisons with a visualization of player success over time (measures of success include, home runs, wins, salaries, etc.)
The data is separated into different files with different themes, so students need to look at the files and decide which to analyze and which topic to focus on. Very friendly for insights via regression.
 
* Crime Statistics and Police Data for Seattle: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Crime-Stats-by-Police-Precinct-2008-Presen/3xqu-vnum. 
Possible questions: How did crime in Seattle has changed over time? Are certain crimes are trending upward? Are certain precincts are experiencing more crime than others (and how has that changed over time)?
Compare it to other cities, such as Berkeley: https://data.cityofberkeley.info/Public-Safety/Berkeley-PD-UCR-Annual-Part-I-Crimes/efkp-2py4.
