NCCA 2010 SITEINFO Metadata for Assessed and Not_Assessed files.		
		
Revised 06.21.2016		
		
"“’Assessed’ data were used to develop the Good, Fair and Poor ratings in the report. ‘Not_Assessed’ data were not used to develop the ratings.”"		
		
"For questions about these data, please contact Hugh Sullivan at sullivan.hugh@epa.gov or use the Contact Us link on the webpage: http://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/forms/national-aquatic-resource-surveys-contact-us"		
"It is the responsibility of the end data user to become familiar with the QA codes used in the NCCA 2010 assessment (NCCA_QA_Codes.csv) and review the ""QA_CODES"" column in each dataset to determine whether the data meet quality objectives for specific uses."		
		
Files	Contents	
Assessed SITEINFO	Contains information about sites used to develop the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment (i.e. Index sites) whether they were sampled or not.	
Not_Assessed SITEINFO	Contains information about sites that were NOT used to develop the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment. Sites may have been supplemental study sites or sites that were dropped and replaced with oversample sites.	
Location information for each site is contained in the SITEINFO Files. Use UID as key column for merging data into the data files.
