    "# Background: diatoms and paleoclimatology\n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms are a type of phytoplankton -- they are photosynthetic algae that function as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Diatoms are at the bottom of the food web: they are consumed by filter feeders, like clams, mussels, and many fish, which are in turn consumed by larger organisms like scavengers and predators and, well, us. As a result, changes in the composition of diatom species in marine ecosystems have ripple effects that can dramatically alter overall community structure in any environment of which marine life forms a part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diatoms have glass bodies. As a group of organisms, they display a great diversity of body shapes, and many are quite elaborate. The image below, taken from a Scientific American article, shows a small sample of their shapes and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='figures/diatoms-sciam.jpg' style='width:400px'></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are made of glass, diatoms preserve extraordinarily well over time. When they die, their bodies sink and form part of the sediment. Due to their abundance, there is a sort of steady rain of diatoms forming part of the sedimentation process, which produces sediment layers that are dense with diatoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedimentation is a long-term process spanning great stretches of time, and the deeper one looks in sediment, the older the material. Since diatoms are present in high density throughout sedimentation layers, and they preserve so well, it is possible to study their presence over longer time spans -- potentially hundreds of thousands of years. \n",
    "\n",
    "A branch of paleoclimatology is dedicated to studying changes in biological productivity on geologic time scales, and much research in this area has involved studying the relative abundances of diatoms. In this assignment, you'll do just that on a small scale and work with data from sediment cores taken in the gulf of California at the location indicated on the map:\n",

This is a common phenomenon in ecological data, and even has a name: it results in a 'zero inflated' distribution of values. The statistician to identify and name the phenomenon was Diane Lambert in 1992. Zero inflation can present a variety of challenges. You may have noticed, for example, that there was no bandwidth parameter for the KDE that *both* captured the shape of the histogram near zero *and* away from zero, regardless of the choice of kernel. The key difficulty with zero inflated data is that no common probability distribution fits the data well. This requires the use of mixtures as probability models, which are challenging to incorporate into common statistical models.\n",
