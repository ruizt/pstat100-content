    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is one of the most widely used Python libraries in data science. In this lab, you will learn commonly used data tidying operations/tools in Pandas. \n",

    "\n",
    "This lab covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataframe basics\n",
    "     - Creating dataframes\n",
    "     - Dataframe indexing and attributes\n",
    "     - Adding, removing, and renaming variables\n",
    "* Operations on dataframes\n",
    "     - Slicing (selecting rows and columns)\n",
    "     - Filtering (selecting rows that meet certain conditions)\n",
    "* Grouping and aggregation\n",
    "     - Summary statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.)\n",
    "     - Grouped summaries\n",
    "     - Chaining operations and style guidelines\n",
    "     - Pivoting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The Pandas interface is notoriously confusing, and the documentation is not consistently great. Be prepared to search through Pandas documentation and experiment, but remember it is part of the learning experience and will help shape you as a data scientist!"
