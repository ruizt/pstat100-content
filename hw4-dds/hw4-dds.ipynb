    "> Most states in the USA provide services and support to individuals with developmental disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, autism, etc.) and their families. The agency through which the State of California serves the developmentally-disabled population is the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) ... One of the responsibilities of DDS is to allocate funds that support over 250,000 developmentally-disabled residents. A number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. This finding was the catalyst for further investigation; subsequently, state legislators and department managers sought consulting services from a statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll analyze the deidentified DDS data published with this article to answer the question: *is there evidence of ethnic or gender discrimination in allocation of DDS funds?* This will involve practicing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* exploratory data visualization\n",
    "* regression analysis\n",
    "* model visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aside**: The JSE article focuses on what's known as [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), an arithmetic phenomenon in which aggregate trends across multiple groups show the *opposite* of within-group trends. We won't emphasize this topic, though the data does provide a nice illustration."

    "For example: the estimate for `Gender_Female` is 0.04; that means that, if age and ethnicity are held fixed, the estimated difference in mean log expenditure between female and male recipients is 0.04. If $\\log(a) - \\log(b) = 0.04$, then $\\frac{a}{b} = e^{0.04} \\approx 1.041$; so the estimated expenditures (not on the log scale) differ by a factor of about 1, *i.e.*, are about the same. Further, the standard error is 0.02, so the estimate is within 2SE of 0; the difference could well be zero. So the model suggests there is no difference in expenditure by gender."
