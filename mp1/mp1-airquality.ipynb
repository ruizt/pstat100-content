    "# Mini project 1: air quality in U.S. cities\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, this project is simple: you are given some data on air quality in U.S. metropolitan areas over time together with several questions of interest, and your objective is to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike the homeworks and labs, there is no explicit instruction provided about *how* to answer the questions or where exactly to begin. Thus, you will need to discern for yourself how to manipulate and summarize the data in order to answer the questions of interest, and you will need to write your own codes from scratch to obtain results. It is recommended that you examine the data, consider the questions, and plan a rough approach before you begin doing any computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have some latitude for creativity: **although there are accurate answers to each question** -- namely, those that are consistent with the data -- **there is no singularly correct answer**. Most students will perform similar operations and obtain similar answers, but there's no specific result that must be considered to answer the questions accurately. As a result, your approaches and answers may differ from those of your classmates. If you choose to discuss your work with others, you may even find that disagreements prove to be fertile learning opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions can be answered using computing skills taught in class so far and basic internet searches for domain background; for this project, you may wish to refer to HW1 and Lab1 for code examples and the [EPA website on PM pollution](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution) for background. However, you are also encouraged to refer to external resources (package documentation, vignettes, stackexchange, internet searches, etc.) as needed -- this may be an especially good idea if you find yourself thinking, 'it would be really handy to do X, but I haven't seen that in class anywhere'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader goal of these mini projects is to cultivate your problem-solving ability in an unstructured setting. Your work will be evaluated based on the following:\n",
    "- choice of method(s) used to answer questions;\n",
    "- clarity of presentation;\n",
    "- code style and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write up your results separately from your codes; codes should be included at the end of the notebook.\n",
