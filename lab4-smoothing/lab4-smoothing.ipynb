    "# Lab 4: Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've encountered a number of visualization techniques for displaying tidy data. In those visualizations, all graphic elements represent the values of a dataset -- they are visual displays of actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, smoothing means evening out. Visualizations of actual data are often irregular -- points are distributed widely in scatterplots, line plots are jagged, bars are discontinuous. When we look at such visuals, we tend to attempt to look past these irregularities in order to discern patterns -- for example, the overall shape of a histogram or the general trend in a scatterplot. Showing what a graphic might look like with irregularities evened out often aids the eye in detecting pattern. This is what **smoothing** is: _**evening out irregularities in graphical displays of actual data**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, usually smoothing will consist in drawing a line or a curve on top of an existing statistical graphic. From a technical point of view, this amounts to adding derived geometric objects to a graphic that have fewer irregularities than the displays of actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn some basic smoothing techniques -- kernel density estimation, LOESS, and linear smoothing via regression -- and how to implement them in Altair.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Altair, smoothing is implemented via what Altair describes as *transforms* -- operations that modify a dataset. Try not to get too attached to this terminology -- 'transform' and 'transformation' are used to mean a variety of things in other contexts. You'll begin with a brief introduction to Altair transforms before turning to smoothing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sections** of the lab are divided as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Introduction to Altair transforms\n",
    "1. Histogram smoothing: kernel density estimamtion\n",
    "2. Scatterplot smoothing: LOESS and linear smoothing\n",
    "3. A neat graphic\n",
    "\n",
    "And our main **goals** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get familiar with Altair transforms for dataframe operations: filter, bin, aggregate, calculate.\n",
    "* 'Handmande' histograms: step-by-step construction\n",
